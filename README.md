## PROJECT

ERC20 Token – Fully functional ERC20 token with mint & burn features

Built with Solidity using OpenZeppelin

Deployable on Testnet / Mainnet

Integrated with MetaMask for transfers and balance checks



ERC1155 NFT Game (MyNFTgame) – Multi-token NFT collection for gaming

Deployed on Holesky Testnet & Mainnet

NFT metadata hosted on IPFS

Integrated with Opensea for collection display

Implemented ERC1155 standard for multiple token types in one contract


ERC721 NFT Collection – Single-token collectible NFTs

Developed with Solidity, OpenZeppelin ERC721

Metadata stored on IPFS, minting through MetaMask

Published on Opensea Mainnet


Voting Contract – On-chain voting system with candidate management

Implemented secure voting with Solidity

Candidate addition, vote casting, and result tracking on-chain

Deployable on Testnet for experimentation


Presale / ICO Contract – Token sale contract with contribution tracking

Allows participants to buy tokens in a presale

Tracks contributions and handles token distribution

Written in Solidity, compatible with OpenZeppelin libraries

Deployable on Ethereum testnets and mainnet
